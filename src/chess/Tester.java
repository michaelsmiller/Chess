 * This is a tester that does almost nothing, but which did show me what was
 * wrong with java's system of sines and cosines. You can run it and see
 * what stupid java has instead of 0 for sin(pi). It's ridiculous. Anyway, this
 * may yet help me in the future so I will keep it around. Also it tested one method
 * that i did not even have time to implement properly.
